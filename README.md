# TennisVideoData
Screen positions for tennis ball during flight.

This project has to do with modeling a spinning tennis ball. The data stored here is screen positions of tennis balls from videos on youtube. Data files have three columns: FRAME #, x Position (pixels), y Position (pixels).

Octave scripts approximate the pixel data in ft (postition), ft/s (velocity) and degrees (velocity angle).
